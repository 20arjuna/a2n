That's good sports. I'm Brandon. Guess what side of my head I slept on the NFL is really warming us up with some intriguing free agency and draft for play. You know, Josh Rosen could be traded out of Arizona for a mid round draft pick and a cheap hot tub. Kyler Murray might be the highest pick in the draft making him and the word highest being used together for the first time in his life and the Denver Broncos along with the Oakland Raiders and the Cardinals again are the top teams interested in wide receiver Antonio Brown for a trade. Let's according to Ian Rapoport on Twitter Broncos reporter. Mike klis said the Broncos denied any claims to wanting to trade for Antonio Brown. So, who do you believe Mike list Orion Rapaport? If you don't live in Denver, you don't know who the fuck Mike klis is but basically Mike klis is reporter who says whatever the Broncos wanted to say. So I don't know how much I would trust my class because the Broncos have
benefit from letting people know that they want to trade for Antonio Brown, but then Ian Rapoport since he works for the NFL Network technically works for Rodger Goodell and you can't trust any man who works for Rodger Goodell so
 Are these rumors true? I don't know but it looks like Nick Foles might be going to the Jags things are getting moist in the NFL. So let's address these rumors before some of them become fact or wheeler. None of them are true at all. That's good sports.
 Real NFL things are happening guys and that gets me excited almost as excited as I am to announce that this episode is sponsored by manscaped.

 Carlos start with the Broncos interest in Antonio Brown since I have been sparse with Broncos news lately some of you may say his Antics. I don't want that on my team in 2012. That was the last year Antonio Brown had fewer than a hundred catches for less than 1200 receiving yards for that kind of production. I look at Antics as fun bonus material to talk about here on thatsgoodsports Brown also included again where the Raiders and Cardinals now Arizona makes sense because Larry Fitzgerald is still the best and only receiving threat on that team in terms of scheme. The Raiders make sense because Jon Gruden might be the best coach to immediately trade Antonio Brown to the Cardinals for the first overall draft picks so they can select Kyler Murray talk about the ultimate.
 And that is the other NFL rumor at the combine that Jon Gruden and Mike Mayock have a massive desire to make Marie a Raider. They have the draft stock for pics in the top 35 tool and Marie and Antonio Brown in my opinion, especially because they can land more draft Equity with a Derek Carr trade the Raiders basically control this draft. So why have the Broncos supposedly shown an interest in Antonio Brown outside the fact that he's one of the best players in the NFL will maybe John Elway is simply fucking with Jon Gruden a division rival tricking the broom grinder into giving up more than you should for Antonio Brown or maybe always simply things Santonio Brown can improve his offense and sees the Steelers as trade partners for say Emmanuel Sanders a draft pick to acquire Brown. What's the biggest thing people criticize Antonio Brown for besides having the kind of mustache that makes pedophiles uncomfortable.
 Asperger what was one of the first things Emmanuel Sanders did after leaving Pittsburgh. He criticized Roethlisberger for being a shity leader. And as crazy as Antonio Brown seems I'm not sure all of this Steelers drama is on him how many wide receivers have complained about Joe Flacco 0 and not just because he never really has any honest team. His nickname is Joe cool for a reason and Antonio Brown and Joe Cool make sense a Lot Like the Way Joe Camel made sense to help sell cigarettes the kids. Perfect. Perfect. Marriage Bill Brown is crazy crazy like a fox baby. He's arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL. I have no idea why anyone wouldn't be excited for their team to acquire him in a trade speeding Throwing Shade off of balcony throwing Roethlisberger under the bus again, his driving record is a fit for Denver. He can throw shit so much further in.
 The high altitude here in Denver so far it would never even come close to hitting a toddler and nobody said shit when Alan faneca through Big Ben under the bus, of course, it was the actual bus drum medicine. That was the standard practice for hazing a rookie quarterback, but still now Ian Rapoport says a lot of stuff on Twitter. It's easy to say TMax are shown interest and supper no repercussions if that's not true, but Nikki jabala posted this article on the athletic today titled John Elway draws lessons from his most successful off season 5 years ago. That was post Seahawks Super Bowl blowout and La grabbed Emmanuel Sanders TJ Ward DeMarcus Ware and Aqib Talib in one offseason, which makes me think Elway is going all-in.
 If that way is drawing from that offseason now that he has Joe Flacco. Then Antonio Brown is peace number to watch the parallels here. Okay wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders came over from the Steelers in 2014. Antonio Brown would fit that mold for LA to follow DeMarcus Ware lab Dallas Demarcus Lawrence might be leaving Dallas now Denver doesn't need him because they have Bradley Chubb but the auction is available for the parallels Denver is going to let Darian Stewart Test free agency, which means they may be in the market for a safety and we know they already need a corner. They already had Peyton Manning on the roster in 2014 of quarterback who had previously beat them in the playoffs and then find their version of TJ Ward and Aqib Talib and this free agency possibly Bryce Callahan and Adrian Amos from the Bears. I would say Earl Thomas as you would be a better compare.
 Listen to TJ Ward but he's 30 years old and wants 15 million a year or maybe he's 15 years old and wants 30 million a year. I don't know either way. Not a good fit for the Broncos or maybe every rumor about Antonio Brown is false. Either way. It looks like I always going to make a big dick Splash in free agency and that should excite Broncos fans. Now, it's looking more and more like old is going to the yeah bars who appear to be the only bidder for the former Super Bowl MVP, even though they'll probably have to dump Malik Jackson and Carlos Hyde to make room for him. Not physically salary salary Cowboys. This is still a team that set up to win right now if they can get an impact rookie in the first round from what I've read. This is the deepest defensive draft in over 50 years or when the word draft just meant you were going to Vietnam. I love Nick Foles going to Jacksonville and I think he'd be great there with that defense what I don't understand is how so many people still
 Question whether or not Nick Foles can play quarterback I said, I'd rather have Nick Foles than Joe Flacco a few weeks ago and you would have thought I said, I would rather give JaMarcus Russell another chance than Joe Flacco. Sporting two in the postseason completed 72% of his passes during the Super Bowl run and put together one of the best QB performances in the Super Bowl. I can remember he brought the Eagles back from dead last season and even though his sample size is weird with his NFL career. I think he'll be great in a pretty good situation. Like the one Jacksonville has to offer now. We still have the ongoing Kyler Murray Josh Rosen Kliff Kingsbury, love triangle to keep an eye on there have been a ton of conflicting reports out there. Some people are saying the Cardinals are set on Kyler Murray with the number one pick others are saying that Arizona has privately told Josh Rosen that he's their quarterback if they do decide to take Marie and this isn't just a Smokescreen.
 One destination that makes a lot of sense would be the Washington Redskin potatoes as I showed in the last video about Rosen and Marie Rose and clearly has a firm grasp on politics and the economy making him a great fit for Washington DC is accusations of the Taliban having wmds. Also having to non broken legs makes him an ideal quarterback in Washington around full circle if Josh Rosen stays in Arizona, I think you would really benefit from having Gerald to hopefully keep a be grounded. If he can't then Josh Rosen will be dealing with the stupid devil and angel on each shoulder Whispering into his ear like we've seen a thousand times on TV except he'll have to listen to that every single play of the game Fitzgerald is the Angel there in case you're an idiot Arizona set on Rosen in Brewton is in love with Kyle.
 I'm married and Marie to Oak Vegas at 4 in the draft is a real possibility. The Cardinals could be showing interest in Murray to convince the Raiders to swap spots with them in the draft and forced Gruden to take Marie at number one all Rumours at this point, but a b and Kyler Murray are making this offseason and draft about a hundred times more interesting than I thought it would be so we'll see what happens. But right now it is fun to conjecture.
 Just conjecturing the shit out of the NFL on Twitter Instagram at Brandon Perna. If you care to follow me there and yes the are trying to catch up.
