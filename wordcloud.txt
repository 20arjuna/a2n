I got last night was the NBA All-Star Game and I one of the biggest plays everyone's talking about is Steph Curry's assist check this out.
 I just bounced back as much fun. We gave him three weird phrases and ask him to sneak them into the interviews. He did over all-star weekend.
 Set afraid the phrases.
 The phrases he had to sneak were Energizer Bunny.
 Flipping pancakes and wham bam can of ham in time I got here Thursday morning. So now I just kind of trying to get as much in as I can got to be like the Energizer buddy by this between us ever since I touched down on the ground Thursday morning for like I've been running running crazy. Now, I got the Energizer Bunny this weekend no job and trying to get through it all back and forth competitions since we're the kids since you're cooking pancakes with the youngest in Charlotte at the time I pick up a basketball. I never like shooting this was kind of second nature like flipping pancakes from being the last one. It just look good for the time. I left her hand. I was like wearing band kind of hand that's going in.
 Annabelle can I have the house?
 Morning, noon and night.
