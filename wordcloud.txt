 I just bounced back as much fun. We gave him three weird phrases and ask him to sneak them into the interviews. He did over all-star weekend.
 Set afraid the phrases.
 The phrases he had to sneak were Energizer Bunny.
 Flipping pancakes and wham bam can of ham it in wrinkle in time. I got here Thursday morning. So now I just kind of trying to get as much in as I can got to be like the Energizer Bunny by this between us ever since I touched down on the ground Thursday morning for like I was running running crazy. Then I got the Energizer Bunny this weekend in a job and trying to get through it all back and forth competitions since we're the kids since you're cooking pancakes with either the youngest in Charlotte from the time I pick up a basketball. I never like shooting this was kind of second nature like flipping pancakes. And then the last one it just look good for the time. I left the hand. I was like wearing band kind of hand that's going in.
